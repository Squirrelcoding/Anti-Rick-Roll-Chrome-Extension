# Anti Rick Roll Chrome Extension!
This handy chrome extension will prevent almost *any* rick roll. As long as its on our list. But there is something that seperates the extension from others.

## How to use
So, all it does is redirect you to a page where it tells you that you were saved from a rick roll, which looks like:
![anti-rick-roll-page](https://i.ibb.co/gt4mjKJ/2021-03-12-5.png)

## Whats different?
Well, you see: You can add and remove blocked URL's! Many other of the rick rolls **dont** support adding and removing blocked URLS! You can even see them within the extension page too! 

# **Privacy Notice!**
This extension collects tab data (such as the tab that you are on) in order to check that its a rick roll URL! By using this extension, you know that your tab data is being used!

# Q & A

### Whats up with the errors when I open up the console?
The errors occur because the script loads before the page, but dont worry! Everything will run just fine!

### How can I get support or report bugs?
You can report them on the [github](https://github.com/Squirrelcoding/Anti-Rick-Roll-Chrome-Extension/issues)

### I just want to listen to "never gonna give you up"!
You can easily disable the chrome extension.

### Why dont you publish the extension to the chrome web store?
1. Im under-age
2. I AM NOT GOING TO PAY 5$ TO SIGN UP TO BE A CHROME WEB STORE DEVELOPER!
